# learning_python
In this repository i will be writing about my progress in learning Python programming language..

my progress in the book "Python for Everybody" :


    Chapter 1 :
        In this chapter, I understood the components of the computer and how they work together
        to execute my instructions "code" and how the processor works, and I also wrote my first
        line of code "program" 
        print("Hello World")
        and I also knew the difference between the compiler and the interpreter and the definition
        of the program which is "a program is a set of statements or instructions for the computer
        to do a certain task or a calculation" and I knew the difference between Syntax errors and
        Logic errors and Semantic errors, and I also knew what Debugging means.
    

    chapter 2 :
        In this chapter, I learned about values and some data types, and I also learned about
        variables and how to name them and assign them, and I also learned about Statements 
        Operators and operands and the order of operations and I learned about String operations
        and string concatenation and how to get info from the user via the built-in function 
        "input", and I learned how to comment and how important comments are. 


chapter 3 :
        in this chapter, I learned about boolean and comparisons and logical operators, and I also
        learned about conditional execution "if else and elif" and nested conditionals and short
        circuit, and I learned about try and except.


chapter 4 :
        in this chapter, I learned that functions are a named sequence of statements that performs
        computation and "returns" the result, which means it's a block of code that I can use as 
        much as I want in the same program, and this block of code could be called by the functions
        name and could take as many values/variables "arguments" as I want it to take!
        and I learned about the built-in functions and how to make my own functions, I also learned
        about the flow of execution.



Chapter 5 :
        In this chapter, I learned how to update variables and I learned about while and for loops, 
        and I learned about infinite loops and how to "break" a loop or to "continue" one.


chapter 6 :
        In this chapter, I learned about strings and that a string is a sequence of characters, and
        I learned about string Indexes and slicing by index, and I also learned that string is 
        immutable, and I learned how to loop through strings, and I learned about the in operator and
        string comparison, and I learned about a function called "dir" which lists the "methods" 
        available for an object, and another function called "help" that I can use to get some simple
        documentation on a method, and I learned about string parsing, and I learned about the "format"
        operator and how to use it.



chapter 7 :
        in this chapter, I learned how to open and read text files and how to search through them,
        and I also learned how to avoid the missing file errors using try and accept, and I learned 
        how to open a file and write something in it and close it.


chapter 8:
        in this chapter, I learned about the lists and how to create them and that they are mutable,
        and I learned about lists methods and functions and I knew how similar strings and lists are
        and how to turn a list of characters into a string and how to turn a string into a list of 
        characters, and I also learned about objects and values.



chapter 9:
       in this chapter, I learned about dictionaries and how to create them, and how to use them as
       a set of counters which is called "histogram", and I also learned about nested loops, and I
       also learned some advanced text parsing methods.
