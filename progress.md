# learning_python
In this repository i will be writing about my progress in learning Python programming language..

my progress in the book "Python for Everybody" :
    Chapter 1 :
        In this chapter, I understood the components of the computer and how they work together
        to execute my instructions "code" and how the processor works, and I also wrote my first
        line of code "program" 
        print("Hello World")
        and I also knew the difference between the compiler and the interpreter and the definition
        of the program which is "a program is a set of statements or instructions for the computer
        to do a certain task or a calculation" and I knew the difference between Syntax errors and
        Logic errors and Semantic errors, and I also knew what Debugging means.
