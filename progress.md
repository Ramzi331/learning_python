# learning_python
In this repository i will be writing about my progress in learning Python programming language..

my progress in the book "Python for Everybody" :


    Chapter 1 :
        In this chapter, I understood the components of the computer and how they work together
        to execute my instructions "code" and how the processor works, and I also wrote my first
        line of code "program" 
        print("Hello World")
        and I also knew the difference between the compiler and the interpreter and the definition
        of the program which is "a program is a set of statements or instructions for the computer
        to do a certain task or a calculation" and I knew the difference between Syntax errors and
        Logic errors and Semantic errors, and I also knew what Debugging means.
    

    chapter 2 :
        In this chapter, I learned about values and some data types, and I also learned about
        variables and how to name them and assign them, and I also learned about Statements 
        Operators and operands and the order of operations and I learned about String operations
        and string concatenation and how to get info from the user via the built-in function 
        "input", and I learned how to comment and how important comments are. 


chapter 3 :
        in this chapter, I learned about boolean and comparisons and logical operators, and I also
        learned about conditional execution "if else and elif" and nested conditionals and short
        circuit, and I learned about try and except.


chapter 4 :
        in this chapter, I learned that functions are a named sequence of statements that performs
        computation and "returns" the result, which means it's a block of code that I can use as 
        much as I want in the same program, and this block of code could be called by the functions
        name and could take as many values/variables "arguments" as I want it to take!
        and I learned about the built-in functions and how to make my own functions, I also learned
        about the flow of execution.
